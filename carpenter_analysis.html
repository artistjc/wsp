<h1>Truffles & Trifles </h1>

<article>
<h2> Site Intent</h2>
The intent for website redesign will be to increase traffic to the site, the amount of time spent on site and the conversion of pages into sales and registrations.

In order to achieve these objectives we will first start by focusing on condensing and organizing information throughout the Truffles & Trifles website. Cleaning up the existing copy and graphics to a more appealing and updated look for the suggested target audience. The goal is to condense the existing information into 6 main pages. The proposed pages include: home, about us, cooking classes, register, shop and contact pages. We want to give the user a more streamlined interface that is both easy for them to use and appealing. 

To help aid in the conversion rates, call to actions will be implemented on home page to promote specific classes or products at the current time. Also use of smaller call to action sections to promote registration and gift certificates on appropriate pages.

<h2> Targeted Audience</h2>
<p>Our primary target audience is women ages 25-54 with a median household income of $50K, married with children owning a single family home. These women are either looking for something new to learn in the kitchen, bonding with others (both friends and husbands) and possibly looking for a different idea for a children's party. This market is not particularly tech-savvy but are frequent users of Facebook and have basic to average computer and internet skills. </p>
